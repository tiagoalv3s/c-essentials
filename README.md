# C Essentials

Throughout this repository I'm sharing my journey on the C Essentials course, offered by C++ Institute. The course consists of part 1 and part 2. My goal is to become proficient on the C language as well as getting the CLA - *C Certified Associate Programmer certification*. It's also an opportunity and motivation to put my hands on Git/GitHub along the course. The codes produced during the course will be organised by modules and LABs.

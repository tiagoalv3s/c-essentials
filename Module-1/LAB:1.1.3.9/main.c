-Scenario:
    Check the program in the editor. Find all possible compilation errors and logic errors. Fix them.
    Your version of the program must print the same result as the expected output. 
    Before you use the compiler, try to find the errors only by manual code analysis.
- Expected output:
    The value of seven is: 7 
    The value of eight is: 8

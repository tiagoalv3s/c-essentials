/*
- Scenario:
    Check the program in the editor. Find all possible compilation errors and logic errors. Fix them.
    Your version of the program must print the same result as the expected output. 
    Before you use the compiler, try to find the errors only by manual code analysis.
- Expected Value:
    The value of six is: 6 
- Given code: 
    #include <stdio.h>
    int main()
    {
        printf("The value of six is: %d \n", 6);
        return 0;
    }
*/

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    printf("\nThe value of six is: %d\n", 6);
    return 0;
}

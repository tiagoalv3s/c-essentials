/*
- Scenario:
    Check the program in the editor. Find all possible compilation errors and logic errors. Fix them.
    Your version of the program must print the same result as the expected output.
    Before you use the compiler, try to find the errors only by manual code analysis.
    Use hexadecimal (base 16) numbers.
- Expected output:
    The value of twenty-one is: 21 
    The value of twenty-two is: 22 
    The value of sixty-two is: 62 
    The value of seventy-four is: 74

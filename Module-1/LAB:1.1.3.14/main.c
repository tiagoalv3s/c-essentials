/*
- Scenario:
    Check the program in the editor. Find all possible compilation errors and logic errors. Fix them.
    Your version of the program must print the same result as the expected output. 
    Before you use the compiler, try to find the errors only by manual code analysis.
    If you want to improve the variable names, then do so, but remember that variable names have to be as descriptive as possible, and also as short as possible.
- Expected output:
    Localhost IP is 127.0.0.1
